Digital skills indicator is a composite indicator based on selected activities performed by individuals on the internet in the specific areas: until 2019, these included information, communication, problem solving and software and from 2021 onwards an additional area, safety, was added. As of 2021 the following overall levels of skills are measured: no skills, limited skills, narrow skills, low skills, basic skills and above basic skills. The level that this indicator assesses – basic and above basic digital skills – has been consistently measured in data since 2015. The data for this indicator comes from the EU survey on the use of ICT (information and communication technologies) in households and by individuals.</p>","subTitle":null,"endOfLife":"The WDDS service will still be operational until 31 of January 2023 after which it will be decommissioned.
