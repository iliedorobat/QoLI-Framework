It is assumed that individuals having performed certain activities have the corresponding skills; therefore the indicator can be considered as a proxy of the digital competences and skills of individuals. The indicator is based on the EU survey on the ICT usage in households and by individuals and is available for the years 2015 and 2016 (it will be compiled in 2017 as well).","subTitle":null,"status":{"label":{"b":"break in time series",":":"not available","u":"low reliability"}}},"class":"dataset","value":{"0":64,"1":65,"2":67,"3":66,"4":60,"5":61,"6":61,"7":61,"8":31,"9":26,"10":29,"11":29,"12":43,"13":43,"14":50,"15":45,"16":57,"17":54,"18":60,"19":62,"20":67,"21":68,"22":68,"23":70,"24":75,"25":78,"26":71,"27":70,"28":65,"29":60,"30":60,"31":62,"32":44,"33":46,"34":46,"35":51,"36":54,"37":53,"38":55,"39":57,"40":74,"41":73,"42":76,"43":76,"44":57,"45":56,"46":57,"47":57,"48":51,"49":55,"50":41,"51":53,"52":50,"53":51,"54":50,"55":49,"56":44,"57":44,"58":48,"59":53,"60":43,"61":44,"63":42,"64":51,"65":52,"66":55,"67":56,"68":86,"69":86,"70":85,"71":65,"72":49,"73":50,"74":48,"75":43,"76":53,"77":50,"78":57,"79":56,"80":72,"81":77,"82":79,"83":79,"84":40,"85":44,"86":46,"87":44,"88":48,"89":48,"90":50,"91":52,"92":26,"93":28,"94":29,"95":31,"96":72,"97":69,"98":77,"99":72,"100":51,"101":53,"102":54,"103":55,"104":53,"105":55,"106":59,"107":54,"108":67,"109":69,"110":71,"111":74},"dimension":{"indic_is":{"label":"indic_is","category":{"index":{"I_DSK_BAB":0},"label":{"I_DSK_BAB":"Individuals who have basic or above basic overall digital skills"}}},"ind_type":{"label":"ind_type","category":{"index":{"IND_TOTAL":0},"label":{"IND_TOTAL":"All Individuals"}}},"unit":{"label":"unit","category":{"index":{"PC_IND":0},"label":{"PC_IND":"Percentage of individuals"}}},"geo":{"label":"geo","category":{"index":{"AT":0,"BE":1,"BG":2,"CY":3,"CZ":4,"DE":5,"DK":6,"EE":7,"EL":8,"ES":9,"FI":10,"FR":11,"HR":12,"HU":13,"IE":14,"IT":15,"LT":16,"LU":17,"LV":18,"MT":19,"NL":20,"PL":21,"PT":22,"RO":23,"SE":24,"SI":25,"SK":26,"UK":27},"label":{"AT":"Austria","BE":"Belgium","BG":"Bulgaria","CY":"Cyprus","CZ":"Czechia","DE":"Germany (until 1990 former territory of the FRG)","DK":"Denmark","EE":"Estonia","EL":"Greece","ES":"Spain","FI":"Finland","FR":"France","HR":"Croatia","HU":"Hungary","IE":"Ireland","IT":"Italy","LT":"Lithuania","LU":"Luxembourg","LV":"Latvia","MT":"Malta","NL":"Netherlands","PL":"Poland","PT":"Portugal","RO":"Romania","SE":"Sweden","SI":"Slovenia","SK":"Slovakia","UK":"United Kingdom"}}},"time":{"label":"time","category":{"index":{"2015":0,"2016":1,"2017":2,"2019":3},"label":{"2015":"2015","2016":"2016","2017":"2017","2019":"2019"}}}},"id":["indic_is","ind_type","unit","geo","time"],"size":[1,1,1,28,4]}
